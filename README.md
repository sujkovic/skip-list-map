std::map implementation using a skip list

Name: Adrian Sujkovic

---

Everything works as expected, I also added a custom test case for the extra credit in the customTest.cpp in the root directory at line 528. It checks to make sure that as map size increases, insertion time increases logarithmically.

Also for compiling different test files, in the makefile change the SOURCE variable to the file name (without the .cpp)
